# tests // design-system-ASK

Small, self-contained regression fixtures. No framework — each is an HTML page you
open in a browser and check by eye (and, where noted, by exporting).

## legend-export-fixture.html

Guards **`export-png.js` legend fidelity**. The page renders a *semantic* legend —
three differently-colored solid swatches, a dotted divider, a group heading, and one
neutral row — and the `PNG page` export must reproduce all of it: the colored
swatches (drawn from each swatch's computed presentation, not a generic box), the
dotted divider, the group heading, and the quiet neutral row, in both light and dark.

A `.row`-only exporter flattened this: every swatch collapsed to the neutral node
fill and the divider / heading were dropped. If that regresses, this fixture shows it.

**Run it** (served from the repo root, so the `../` foundations resolve):

```
python3 -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080/tests/legend-export-fixture.html
```

Click **`PNG page`** in the HUD and compare the exported raster against the live
legend. Toggle `data-theme` on `<html>` (or your OS appearance) to check both themes.
